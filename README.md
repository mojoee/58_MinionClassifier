# Minion Classifier


## Todos

* Collect and preprocess data:

Gather a labeled dataset containing images for each class you want to classify.
Resize images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 pixels) if they have different dimensions.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, typically using an 80-10-10 or 70-15-15 ratio.
Normalize pixel values to a standard scale, such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1].

* Choose a machine learning algorithm:

For image classification, deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically used. You can create a custom architecture or use a pre-trained model like VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet and perform transfer learning.

* Training

Train the CNN using your training dataset. For Python, you can use popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow (Keras) or PyTorch.
Evaluate and fine-tune the model:

Measure the performance of your model on the validation set using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.
Experiment with different model hyperparameters, architectures, or transfer learning strategies to improve performance.
If needed, use techniques like dropout, batch normalization, or data augmentation to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

* Testing

Once you've fine-tuned your model, evaluate its performance on the test dataset to get an unbiased assessment of how well it generalizes to unseen data.
Deploy the model:

Save your trained model for future use or integration into a larger system (e.g., web application, mobile app, or API).
